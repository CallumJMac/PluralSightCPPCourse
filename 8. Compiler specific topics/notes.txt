Compiler specific topics:

vscode
- Create new project
- may create new files you dont need
- dont destroy unwanted files


- command line arguments
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) #when someone passes in parameters from the command prompt
{
    return 0;
}

small.exe -g Hello 12
clang++ a.cpp b.cpp #not a common technique these days

argv[] #old C-style way to do a collection
char* #old C-style way to do a string
argc  #is the count of how many args are passed






#pragma once
-prevents a file from being included multiple times
    -compiler errors about declaring things twice
    -A includes B and C, they both include days

-not oficially standard
    -all major compiler support this
